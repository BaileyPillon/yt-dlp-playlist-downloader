MFW when I daydream about all my favorite YouTube videos that get deleted.

Downloads Youtube playlist links via yt-dlp as both mp4s and mp3s. The inspiration for this simple .py script is because of the constant YouTube deletions.

# TO DO

Add directory sorting

Add metadata for deleted videos udner a playlist (yes, really, it's possible)

Optimize such that mp4s and mp3s can be downloaded or converted at once rather than downloaded separately.

Optimize for downlaod speed.

Add requirements - which are yt-dlp (fork of yt-dl), ffmpeg, and more.

Add the command lines I personally use if you wish to manually use yt-dlp rather than by Python script.
